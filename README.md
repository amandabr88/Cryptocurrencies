# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an analysis for the cryptocurrency market. For this one, the data will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we have used unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we used the clustering algorithm.
